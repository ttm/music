## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- `stretches()` raised `AttributeError` on abandoned scratch code and could
  index one sample past the fragment it was resampling.
- `trill()` raised `TypeError: 'module' object is not callable`. Submodules of
  `music.core.filters` share names with the functions re-exported from them,
  and the filters/synths import cycle bound the module during partial
  initialisation.
- `louds()` raised a broadcasting `ValueError` whenever the envelope was
  shorter than the sonic vector it was applied to.
- `write_wav_mono` / `write_wav_stereo` could not write 8-bit files, and the
  64-bit files they produced could not be read back by `read_wav`. Supported
  depths are now 8, 16 and 32, with the unsigned offset that 8-bit WAV
  requires.
- A scalar `fades` argument to the WAV writers was silently ignored.
- `adsr()` gave its sustain stage a negative length on sounds shorter than the
  attack, decay and release combined; the stages are now compressed
  proportionally. Zero-length stages no longer divide by zero or stretch the
  envelope, and single-sample transitions no longer leak NaN.
- `requires-python` corrected from `>=3.0` to `>=3.10`.
- Passing a tuple or an ndarray subclass as `sonic_vector` was silently
  ignored by `adsr`, `fade`, `loud`, `louds`, `tremolo`, `tremolos`, `am`,
  `reverb` and `adsr_stereo`: they detected a supplied vector with
  `type(x) in (np.ndarray, list)` and returned a default-duration envelope
  instead of the caller's audio. All sixteen sites now go through
  `music.utils.as_sonic_vector`. The historical scalar `0` sentinel still
  means "not supplied", so existing callers are unaffected.
- The WAV writers rejected a numpy integer scalar as `fades` with an
  `IndexError`, because `np.int64` does not subclass `int`.
- Writing a sonic vector containing NaN or infinity cast it to arbitrary
  integers and wrote them as audio; it now raises `ValueError`.
- `stretches()` raised `ZeroDivisionError` deep in its resample loop when a
  duration was zero; it now rejects non-positive durations up front.
- Writing and reading a WAV back was not unity gain: the writer scaled by
  `2 ** (bit_depth - 1) - 1` while `read_wav` divided by `2 ** (bit_depth
  - 1)`, so a round trip lost about 1.5 quantisation steps rather than the
  half step the quantiser costs. The writer now uses the same scale, and
  exactly representable levels survive a round trip unchanged.

### Changed
- `requirements.txt` now installs from `pyproject.toml` rather than repeating
  it. The two had drifted: it pinned `setuptools==69.0.2` (a build tool, not a
  runtime dependency, and the source of three open Dependabot alerts — two
  high) and `percolation==0.2.dev0`, which the package does not import, and
  its `==` pins contradicted pyproject's `>=` ranges.
- `localize_linear()` was never finished — its own body notes the missing
  return statement — and now raises `NotImplementedError` instead of crashing.
  It is no longer re-exported from `music`. Use `localize()` or
  `note_with_doppler()`.
- Module-level `np.random.uniform` and `note()` default arguments moved into
  their function bodies, dropping about 2.4 MB and half the import time.
- Tests import the package the way a user does, via a single root
  `conftest.py`, instead of per-file `sys.path` edits.
- `normalize_mono` / `normalize_stereo`: documented what `remove_bias`
  actually selects between (centre-and-scale versus an affine map onto
  [-1, 1]), and removed a stray duplicate entry from the Returns section.

### Added
- `tests/test_fidelity.py`, checking that the synthesized *samples* match the
  equations the docstrings cite, not merely that they have the right shape:
  `note` and `note_with_vibrato` against their closed forms sample for
  sample, the vibrato's semitone span, tremolo and ADSR levels in the
  decibels their parameters are stated in, every noise colour's dB/octave
  slope, `localize`'s interaural delay and amplitude ratio against the ear
  geometry, and WAV round-trip error against the quantiser step.
- `tests/test_public_api.py`, sweeping every export callable with its
  documented defaults, plus a regression test for each defect above.
- GitHub Actions running ruff, mypy and pytest on Python 3.10-3.13. The
  `[tool.mypy]` section no longer pins `python_version`, so mypy targets the
  interpreter it runs under; pinned to 3.11 it could not parse numpy's own
  stubs when run on 3.12+.
- `py.typed`, so the package's type annotations reach consumers.
- `music.__version__`, sourced from package metadata.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-07-21
### Added
- `Sequencer` module for scheduling notes and writing renders.
- `play_audio` utility for quickly previewing sonic vectors.
- `singing_demo` and `binaural_beats` example scripts.
- Mypy configuration and type hints across the package.

### Changed
- WAV reading now detects bit depth automatically.
- Various bug fixes and documentation improvements.
