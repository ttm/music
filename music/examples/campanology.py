"""
Notice that you might relate a peal or any set of permutations to a sonic
characteristic (frequency, duration, vibrato depth, vibrato frequency, attack
duration, etc.) through at least 3 methods:
1) initiate a Being(), set its permutations to the permutation sequence, its
   domain to the values to be permuted, and its curseq to the name of theBeing
   sequence to be yielded by the permutation of the domain.
2) Achieve the sequence of values through peal.act() or just using permutation
   (domain) for all the permutations at hand. Then render the note directly
   (e.g. using M.core.V_) or passing the sequence of values to a synth, such
   as Being().
